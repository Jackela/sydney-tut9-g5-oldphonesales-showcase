# E-commerce Platform for Used Phones (TUT9-G5)

A full-stack e-commerce platform for selling used phones, built with the MERN stack.

## üìñ Project Goal & Motivation

This project aimed to deliver a complete, functional full-stack e-commerce platform specifically designed for selling used phones. The motivation was to gain practical experience in building modern web applications using a popular technology stack and implementing core e-commerce functionalities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technical Highlights

*   **MERN Stack Application**: Developed using the **MERN stack** (**MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React**, **Node.js**), providing a robust and scalable foundation for web development.
*   **RESTful API Backend**: Features a powerful **Node.js** and **Express.js** backend that exposes a **RESTful API** for all data operations, ensuring clear separation of concerns and efficient data exchange.
*   **Dynamic React Frontend**: A dynamic and interactive user interface built with **React**, offering a smooth and responsive user experience.
*   **User Authentication**: Implemented a secure user authentication system using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for managing user sessions and access control.
*   **API Documentation**: API endpoints are clearly documented using **Swagger**, facilitating easy integration and understanding for other developers.
